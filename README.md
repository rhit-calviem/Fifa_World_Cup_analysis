## Abstract

We analyzed data on international football matches from 1872 to 2023 encompassing a total of roughly 74,518 matches. The dataset included various match types, ranging from friendly matches to FIFA World Cup matches. Using the dataset, we determined some of the best players like Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and Robert Lewandowski along with some of the best teams such as Brazil, Germany, and Argentina. We then dived into a deeper analysis of the FIFA World Cup, looking into attendance records and progress of teams over time, looking both at the greatest teams of all time, especially European and South American teams, and some newer and smaller teams, like Belgium, Morocco, and Japan.

## 1. Introduction

Football has become the most-watched sport in the world, creating a huge pool of fans and increasing the expectations for everyone’s national team to perform well on an international stage. Recognized as the pinnacle of football, the FIFA World Cup showcases the culmination of skill, passion, and national pride. A data-driven, statistical analysis of previous World Cups will help us draw conclusions about the top players, top teams, and diversity in the tournament. This information can allow us to make predictions about future World Cups and the future of international football. For this report, we will detail the top players, teams, diversity, and popularity of the tournament over the years, and take a look into which teams have historically improved or declined. Further, we will delve into one of the biggest rivalries of the World Cup, European teams vs. South American teams. Finally, we will also study some of the more recent World Cups to try and draw conclusions about recent team performance and what that means for future World Cups.

## 2. Data Preparation

The initial dataset [1] from Kaggle, contained three separate datasets all relating to International Football Matches. This dataset included 74,518 results of international football matches starting from the very first official match in 1872 up to 2023. The matches were strictly men’s full internationals and the data did not include Olympic Games or matches where at least one of the teams was the nation’s B-team, Under-23, or a league select team. The first file contained the results of each match, highlighting what team won if they were the home or away team, and what the score was. The second file, ’shootouts.csv’, contained data on penalty shootouts highlighting the specific results and teams involved in these decisive moments. Lastly, the ’goalscorers.csv’ file included information on the goal scorers for each match. This was easily the biggest file, even though a majority of the games ended 0-0. The first step in the data preparation was to merge these three files. To merge these datasets, Python’s pandas library was utilized. Both the ’results.csv’ and ’shootouts.csv’ contained columns for date, home team, and away team. A left join was used to merge these two files in order to retain all records. Next, the resulting data frame was merged with the ’goalscorers.csv’ file. This file also had the same common columns so another left join was used. Performing the merges was easy; however, there were some slight problems: the older matches from 1872 had significantly less recorded data than the newer and most recent matches, which meant that a lot of the data was null, making it harder to merge some of the attributes of the dataset.

Utilizing the merged dataset along with the Average and total attendance at FIFA football World Cup games from 1930 to 2018 [2] from Statista, we were able to create a merged dataset combining World Cup-specific statistics with their attendance data. Further adding in attendance information for the Qatar World Cup from the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup Attendance dataset [3] from Kaggle ensured that our merged dataset would contain information about all of the World Cups. In order to merge the datasets, the attendance dataset required dropping an unnamed row coupled with separating the year and location and renaming “USA” to “United States” to facilitate the merge.

## 3. "Football" Statistics

While analyzing the international matches for the World Cup Games, we looked into some entertaining information like top players and top teams; the results that we were able to get from the dataset are shown in Figure 1.

![Figure 1: Interesting Stats](https://github.com/rhit-calviem/Fifa_World_Cup_analysis/blob/main/images/intersting_stats.PNG)

We discovered that the top player, based on goals scored, is by far Cristiano Ronaldo followed by some other great names like Lewandoski, Kane, and Messi. These are major players that have influenced the world of soccer in the past decades and all played their last World Cup in Argentina in 2022. The best team, still based on goals scored, is Brazil. This is expected as football is a big part of Brazil’s culture and they have had a lot of incredible players that have revolutionized the history and technique of football, like Pelé, Kaká, Neymar, Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, and Carlos Alberto. An interesting detail is that while Brazil has won over 1400 matches in the past 200 years, the number of ties is almost 10 times as much: there have been 14,000 ties in international matches. This is an extremely high number but is to be expected as many matches tend to end up with a very close score leading sometimes to penalty shootouts. Penalty shootouts occur on rare occasions, only during the final stages of major tournaments. 33 countries have never gone into penalty shootouts and the team that has won the most penalty shootouts is Argentina. Their last penalty shootout was the famous victory of the FIFA World Cup where they beat France in 2022.

Continuing to explore this immense dataset, we started to look into the diversity of team appearances in the World Cup. A graph exploring this topic is seen in Figure 2. This chart contains the appearance information for the top 10 teams in terms of appearances. Unsurprisingly some of the better teams like Brazil, Argentina, and Germany have the most appearances. Analyzing the data from 1930 to 2022, a total of 82 countries out of 195 total countries made an appearance in the World Cup. This number, encompassing a pure 42% of countries is quite a small number proving the sheer difficulty of making the World Cup.

## 4. Results

In the past years, there have been a lot of upsets and a lot of ’underdog’ teams have made it past the group stages, eliminating some of the favorites. We decided to analyze team performance over the years to see if only the major teams that have a long history in football have been qualifying and making it to the end of the World Cup, or if newer and smaller teams have been exceeding expectations. We based our criteria for performance on two categories: Net Games (games won - games lost) and the number of goals scored. For each of these criteria, we found the most improved team and the least improved team. The graphs for these teams can be seen in Figure 3.

![Figure 3: Performance Comparison](https://github.com/rhit-calviem/Fifa_World_Cup_analysis/blob/main/images/performance.PNG)

To create the graphs we had to find every country that had ever played a home or away team in the World Cup and calculated the net number of games (games won minus games lost) for each team as well as the number of goals scored. To ensure accurate analysis, we filtered out teams with insufficient data, considering only those with a minimum number of 10 matches played. We identified the most improved and least improved teams over the years and plotted the performance trends of these teams over time, utilizing regression analysis to visualize their performance trajectories.

The two graphs for performance on games show Belgium as the most improved team and the United States as the worst improved team. Belgium is a very small country and, while it has produced incredibly talented players like Romelu Lukaku and Kevin De Bruyne, it has always been very difficult for it to exceed in any international competitions due to the fact that there is a small population. Belgium has, however, had tremendous success as it is the only national team in the world to top the FIFA ranking without having won a World Cup or a continental trophy. On the other hand, the United States is ranked as the worst-improved team. This is mainly due to the fact that the United States has only had 11 appearances in the World Cup: between 1950 and 1990 the United States did not participate in any of the 10 editions. This has a huge toll on the performance graph as in the most recent years it has had a lot more successes.

The two graphs that analyze performance on goals scored highlight England as the most improved and Sweden as the least improved. England is a country with a lot of history in football and it has done extremely well in the past years too. Getting to the final matches in the World Cup doesn’t always mean that you have scored a lot of goals, but England exceeded expectations by scoring over 100 goals in the last two editions of the tournament. The worst-performing team, based on this criterion, is Sweden. Sweden is a small country with a small team known for its extreme defensive style in play. Sweden has produced many talents, like Zlatan Ibrahimovic, but the trend line highlights that the team is having difficulty scoring goals and, furthermore, making it past the qualifying stages of the World Cup as they have qualified only 3 times in the last 7 editions.

![Figure 4: Team Performance in 2018 and 2022](https://github.com/rhit-calviem/Fifa_World_Cup_analysis/blob/main/images/team_performance.PNG)

After examining long-term trends in World Cup performance, we narrowed our focus to a short-term comparison between the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. This analysis is shown in Figure 4. The graph displays the relationship between goals scored and games won during these two recent tournaments, illustrating that while the majority of teams clustered around moderate performance metrics, a select few such as France and Argentina stand out for their exceptional success in both scoring and winning games.

## 5. European Teams vs South American Teams

The FIFA World Cup is a battleground for regional rivalries, none more intense than the competition between European and South American teams. Historically, these two continents have produced the most World Cup-winning teams, creating a storied rivalry steeped in football history. Europe, represented by giants like Germany, Italy, and France, and South America, with powerhouses such as Brazil and Argentina, have both claimed numerous titles. However, beyond the number of titles, this rivalry extends to a comparison of playing styles, tactical approaches, and the impact of cultural factors on footballing success. By analyzing performance metrics such as wins, losses, goals scored, and goals conceded, we gain insight into the distinctive characteristics and evolving dynamics of this enduring football rivalry.

Our in-depth statistical analysis compared the performance of European and South American teams in every World Cup since 1930, providing a comprehensive overview of how these two footballing continents stack up against each other. This section covers historical data analysis, charts comparing overall performance, and an examination of the key factors that have influenced the outcomes of their encounters on the world stage.

## 6. Conclusion

Our comprehensive analysis of international football matches and FIFA World Cup data provided insights into the top players, teams, and trends in the world of football. We identified the best players, such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and Robert Lewandowski, along with top teams like Brazil, Germany, and Argentina. By delving into the diversity and evolution of teams in the World Cup, we highlighted the emergence of newer, smaller teams such as Belgium, Morocco, and Japan, while also examining the historical success of European and South American powerhouses. Additionally, we analyzed team performance over time, identifying the most and least improved teams based on metrics such as net games won and goals scored. Through a detailed examination of the European vs. South American rivalry, we explored the distinctive characteristics and evolving dynamics of these two footballing continents. Overall, our analysis sheds light on the rich history and ongoing developments in international football, providing a data-driven perspective on the sport's most prestigious tournament, the FIFA World Cup.
